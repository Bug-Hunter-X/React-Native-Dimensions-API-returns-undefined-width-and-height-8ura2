This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, and the app crashes or behaves unexpectedly. The `Dimensions` API returns an object with `width` and `height` properties. However, these values are sometimes undefined or incorrect when the app starts or rotates. This leads to unexpected app behavior and may cause crashes if components rely on the dimensions in their rendering logic before they're available.
